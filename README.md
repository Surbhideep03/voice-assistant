🎙️ Voice Assistant – Talk to Your Python Program!
Hey there! 👋 This is a simple voice assistant that listens to what you say 🎤, converts it to text 📜, and then responds using text-to-speech 🔊. It's a fun little project that brings speech recognition and AI together!

✨ What It Can Do
✅ Listen to your voice using a microphone
✅ Understand what you're saying and turn it into text
✅ Talk back to you using text-to-speech
✅ Keep listening until you say "exit" to stop

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Install the Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio
🔹 Windows users: If pyaudio gives you errors, run:

bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
2️⃣ Run the Script
Once everything is set up, just run:

bash
python assistant.py
Your assistant will greet you and start listening! 🎧

🎤 How It Works
1️⃣ The assistant welcomes you and waits for your voice input
2️⃣ It recognizes what you say and prints it on the screen
3️⃣ It speaks back whatever you said using text-to-speech
4️⃣ If you say "exit", it stops and says goodbye!

💡 Troubleshooting
🔹 Mic not working? Run this test:

bash
python -m speech_recognition
🔹 Pyaudio installation error? (Windows users) Try:

bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
